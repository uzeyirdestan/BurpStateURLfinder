# BurpStateURLfinder

Do you need URLs in the Burp state file ?
But you are lazy as me dont wanna open that burp and state files.
This tool is for you.
You can prepare your own dictionary.
It parses GET|POST|PUT|HEAD|DELETE|OPTIONS types of requests in state file, sorts and saves into new file.
Suggest me anything and we make it better together.
